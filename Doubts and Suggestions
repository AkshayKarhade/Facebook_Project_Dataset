I am facing some issues that I am unable to google my way out. Any suggestions or help is appreciated.

1. The "A value is trying to be set on a copy of a slice from a DataFrame. 
Try using .loc[row_indexer,col_indexer] = value instead" warning is something I am unable to get rid of. 
    
I have tried the following:
a. add .copy() to the column being created but it leads to unstable behavior as the new column sometimes gets 
   added to the df sometime sit doesnt.
b. add .loc[row_indexer,col_indexer] , Here I am not sure I understand what is row_indexer and,col_indexer. 

2. The Preferred mode is something I tried to calculate successfully but I have been unable to plot a bar graph with multiple values on the X axis.
Still need to brush up the Matplotlib concepts. Any suggestions?

Absolutely None My friend.
