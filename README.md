# Facebook_Project_Dataset
This is an academic project I have done as part of the Data Analytics with Python course on UpX Academy.

Assuming that Facebok has decided to release a special feature for the Social Marketing opporunities for C2C and B2C businesses. We will perform an EDA for the facebook management to help them understand who to target for such an update and where they can reap the most ROI for their campaign.

One of the primary requirments for any successful Social Marketing campaign is campaign reach. Maximum reach can be gained by people with most number of friends.

Then we filter out the most influential users by figuring out the number of likes that they recieved.

The next factor that affects the campaign is the quality of the content. Which needs to be optimised for certain screen/device resolution. Hence, understanding the reach of these high friend count users is more on Mobile or Desktop. (Yet to be completed)


Once we have filtered the high friend count users and their preferred mode of followership thats when we focus on precise gender and age group that we will be targetting to get the most benefits of this campaign.

We can also filter out users who have spent alot of time on our platform to build a hypothisis to find the expected trust that user will have on any service we introduce.

Truly inspiratoinal poeple will have less numberof friends requests they have initiated and have accepted more.

People with more number of likes than 2 times the number of friends suggest that the content they have already been posted is widely accepted.

In the end, once this analysis is complete we will have the following knowledge of the users and our campaign strategy can be worked on using this analysis.

1. Users with most reach.
2. Most preferred mode of platform useage by our specific users.
3. Most influential users.
4. The Gender and Age distribution amongst the filtered users.
5. Validity check of people who are actually influential.

The information hence acquired will help us in the following way:

1. We will know exactly what kind of design and content we need to use to grab attention of our intended userbase.
2. We will know exactly which of our platforms is most used by our users. This will not only help the management to decide on the resolution and optimization of the content for specific resolution but this information will also be useful for the people who use this feature as to decide on what kind of content they need to reach their fan following.
3. We will have the precise list of users we need to target who might be interested in our service.
